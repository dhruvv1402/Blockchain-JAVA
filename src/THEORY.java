I have implemented core blockchain concepts like distributed ledger structure, cryptographic hashing,
consensus mechanisms through proof-of-work, transaction processing, mining with rewards, and blockchain validation.
For future scope, I've outlined several potential enhancements that would make this blockchain more robust and
feature-rich, including:
1.Adding proper cryptographic security with digital signatures
2.Implementing networking capabilities for true distributed operation
3.Developing smart contract functionality
4.Making scalability improvements
5.Creating wallet implementations for end-users
6.Adding privacy features

This project has given me hands-on experience with the fundamental principles that power blockchain technology.
While this implementation is primarily educational, it demonstrates my understanding of the core mechanisms
that make blockchains work, from the cryptographic linking of blocks to the economic incentives that secure the network.
