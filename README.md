# Blockchain-Java

🚀 A **Java-based** blockchain implementation that demonstrates the fundamentals of blockchain technology, including block creation, proof-of-work, and transaction handling. Ideal for learning how blockchain works under the hood!

## 🔥 Features

- **Custom Blockchain Implementation** 🏗️
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW) Algorithm** ⛏️
- **SHA-256 Cryptographic Hashing** 🔑
- **Transaction Handling & Validation** 💰
- **Block Mining & Chain Verification** 🔍
- **Decentralization Concepts** 🌍 (Basic P2P networking support planned)

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java JDK 11+**
- **Maven** (Optional for dependency management)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhruvv1402/Blockchain-JAVA.git
   cd Blockchain-JAVA
   ```

2. **Compile & Run the Project**
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
   java src.Blockchain
   ```

## 📡 How It Works

### 🏗️ Creating the Blockchain
Each block contains:
- **Index**: Block position in the chain
- **Timestamp**: Time of creation
- **Transaction Data**: List of transactions
- **Previous Hash**: Hash of the previous block
- **Nonce**: Proof-of-work value
- **Current Hash**: Unique identifier for the block

### ⛏️ Proof of Work (PoW)
To add a new block, the miner must solve a **cryptographic puzzle** (finding a nonce that makes the hash meet a difficulty target).

### 🔄 Adding Transactions
Users can create transactions, which are stored in a **pending transactions list** until they are mined into a new block.

💡 **Fun Fact**: Did you know the first blockchain, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 by an anonymous person (or group) named Satoshi Nakamoto? 🤯

🚀 Happy coding and blockchain building! 🔗🔥
